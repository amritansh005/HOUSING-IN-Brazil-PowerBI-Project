In my recent real estate analysis project, I utilized a dataset comprising 21,000 properties to investigate the impact of property size and location on real estate prices in Brazil. My analysis involved importing and preprocessing data from a CSV file, generating insightful data visualizations, and examining the correlation between property size, location, and price using Power BI. This project allowed me to demonstrate my ability to manipulate data, perform statistical analysis and interpret results effectively.
