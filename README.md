In this real estate analysis project, I utilized a dataset comprising 21,000(approx) properties for analysis. It's a real time but old data obtained from a company website. My analysis involved importing and pre-processing data from an excel file in python, cleaning it and generating insightful data visualizations using Power BI. This project allowed me to demonstrate my ability to manipulate data, perform statistical analysis and interpret results effectively.


The main questions that I have tried to answer are as follows:


Q. Which factor has a stronger influence on real estate prices: property size or location?

Q. What is the relationship between property size and price? (Likely looking for correlation strength and direction)

Q. What is the relationship between location and price? (This might involve comparing prices across different locations, perhaps using visualizations)

Q. How can I effectively visualize the relationships between these variables to understand the trends?
